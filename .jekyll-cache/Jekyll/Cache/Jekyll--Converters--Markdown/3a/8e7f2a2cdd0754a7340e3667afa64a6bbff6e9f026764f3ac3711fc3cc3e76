I"å<p>Like a lot of people when they were young, I donâ€™t enjoy learning (although I actually did, I just donâ€™t think I liked School), but itâ€™s my favourite thing to do now.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I made this site to further push myself to learn, itâ€™s really a home base for any projects I do so I can look back on progress. I wish I had done this a long time ago as it would have helped me keep focus.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I feel like I have a solid foundation in CS and IT but my work has been all over the place and Iâ€™ve been poor at documenting since I left school. Putting something like this on display means I hold my self accountable to continued learning. I can also look back on progress through blog posts (even if no one else reads).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The project display is automatically pulled from Github so I guess I could be just treating my profile on Github as my base, but I thought it might be interesting to have it set up in this way. Possibly in the future Iâ€™d make the display a bit more interesting.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m also going to try blogging as it should help me with writing and actually cement learning. I donâ€™t know if it will be of use to anyone else but the takeaway is try it yourself!</p>
