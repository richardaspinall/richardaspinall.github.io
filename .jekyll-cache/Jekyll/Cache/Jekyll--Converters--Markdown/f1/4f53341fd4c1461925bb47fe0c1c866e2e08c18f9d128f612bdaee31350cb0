I"@<p>I love learning – it’s my favourite thing to do.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I feel like I have a solid foundation in CS and IT but my work has been all over the place and I’ve been poor at documenting since I left school. Putting something like this on display means I hold my self accountable to continued learning.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The projects display is automatically pulled from Github so I guess I could be just treating my profile on Github as my base, but I thought it might be interesting to have it set up in this way. Possibly in the future I’d make the display a bit more interesting.</p>

<p><br />
 The website overall showcases that I can work with HTML, CSS &amp; JS (definitely no pro) and it’s something that I’ve wanted to have an anchor to for those hard skills.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I made this site to further push myself to learn, it’s really a home base for any projects I do so I can look back on progress. I do wish I had done this a long time ago as it would have helped me keep focus, but it’s better late than never!</p>
