                I work for Slack in the Platform Support team and I love it. I get to help customers and developers use
                our API to come up with solutions to their own problems. It's an amazing role and I get to work with
                amazing people. I love problem solving with technology, which I get to do in my work every day at Slack.

                My main focus is to learn and grow in the technology space as I find my passions revolve
                around it. This includes personal projects and courses which directly help in my work as I can
                develop more empathy for our developers, understanding how our documentation should flow,
                give better feedback, develop better troubleshooting skills.
