                I work for Slack as a Platform Support Agent and I love it. I get to help developers use our API to
                connect their services. It's an amazing role and I get to work with amazing people.

                My main focus is to learn to code better as I find my work and my passions revolve around
                it. It helps with my work as I can develop more empathy for our developers, understanding how our
                documentation should flow, give better feedback, develop better troubleshooting skills.. the list
                goes on! But I just enjoy it really!
