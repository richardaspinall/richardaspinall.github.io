                I work for Slack in the Platform Support team and I love it. I get to help customers and developers use
                our API to integrate their services with Slack. It's an amazing role and I get to work with
                amazing people. I love problem solving with technology, which I get to do in my work every day at Slack.

                Currently my <i>North Stars</i> are to learn and grow in the technology space as my passions
                revolve around it. This includes programming, personal projects and completing courses which
                directly help in my work as I gain more empathy for developers.
