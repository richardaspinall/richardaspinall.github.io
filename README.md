## Description
A portfolio website to showcase projects and write blog posts

## Goals
* A base for my any projects I complete
* A "profile" for myself that I can tell my story from
* Track progress of learnings

## Requirements
* Node (for projects to be pulled in prebuild)
* Ruby and Jekyll (gem) see: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

### Development

- Live Server (VSCode extension) running on `_static` build for instant refresh
- `jekyll serve` to build to `_site` on save
- `jekyll build` to build to `_site`

### Production
