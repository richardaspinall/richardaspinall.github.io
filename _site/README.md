## Steps
1. Created build with Jekyll and set up Github actions to automatically build the website

## Usage

* `jekyll serve` to build to `_site` on save
* `jekyll build` to build to `_site`

### Production
* Push to main branch which will automatically build `_site` to gh-pages from the Github actions workflow
