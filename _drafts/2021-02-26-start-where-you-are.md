I was recommended a book called Designing Your Life via my professional coach. This book takes you through "how to build a well-lived joyful life". There are simple exercises on each chapter that guide and help you come up and with a bit of a solution to what you should be doing now and into the future.

Takeaways:

- [summary of how full I am]
