I love learning â€“ it's my favourite thing to do.

<br>

I feel like I have a solid foundation in CS and IT but my work has been all over the place and I've been poor at documenting since I left school. Putting something like this on display means I hold my self accountable to continued learning.

<br>

The projects display is automatically pulled from Github so I guess I could be just treating my profile on Github as my base, but I thought it might be interesting to have it set up in this way. Possibly in the future I'd make the display a bit more interesting.

<br>

Overall the website showcases that I can work with HTML, CSS & JS (definitely no pro) and it's something that I've wanted to have an anchor to for those skills.

<br>

I made this site to further push myself to learn, it's really a home base for any projects I do so I can look back on progress. I do wish I had done this a long time ago as it would have helped me keep focus, but it's better late than never!
