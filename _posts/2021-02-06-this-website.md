I love learning â€“ it's my favourite thing to do. I feel like I have a solid foundation in CS and IT but my work has been all over the place and I've been poor at documenting since I left school. Putting something like this on display means I hold my self accountable to continued learning.

I made this site to further push myself to learn, it's really a home base and anchor for any projects so I can look back on progress. It is to point to projects but more specifically the learnings I go on. I'm trying
to make sure that I add the steps I take within a readme for each project, or / and a blog post.

I do wish I had done this a long time ago as it would have helped me keep focus, but it's better late than never!
