Yesterday I felt like I had a very wholesome day which made me feel super accomplished. 

<br>

**My typical day:**
- A lot of screentime
    - Work
    - Programming
    - YouTube holes
    - General phone holes (and repeated through out the day): news, social media etc
    - TV / Netflix etc
- Reading text books (Programming theory)

<br>
    
**My wholesome day:**
- Listened to music 
- Cooked food 
- Played a game with a friend 
- Watched some sports
- Went for a skate
- Programming
- Programming theory (reading) 
- Small amount of phonetime
- Netflix 

<br>

While I still spent a lot of time on screens, I didn't go down any holes and I added some extra activities that formed a well balanced day; cooking is a rarity for me but I enjoyed it! I recently bought a skateboard to learn something new. I hadn't gamed in over a year but my friend asked if I wanted to play something chill.

I didn't think I could fit that much in a day but I did and it felt great.
