Over the past 2 years on and off I've been attacking a project ([repo](https://github.com/richardaspinall/slack-chrome-timezone-converter)) that started off very small. It was time to move on and say "it's complete". The root issue of why this was taking so long was that I hadn't scoped what complete looked like. Once I defined this, it was easy to say if it was complete or not.

<br>

_Complete_ meant that I acknowledged the things that were incomplete and didn't work as I would have liked and what I would need to do or learn to get it to that state. Acknowleding that the project had bloated and it required me to learn a lot more than what I had first envisioned, I started to be less hard on myself and realized what I was trying to achieve wasn't so simple. Obviously I can only define _complete_ in this way because I had no outside invested interest. This is a good and bad thing I have learned!

**Key learnings:**

<br>
- Webpack is confusing when starting out
- Embedding into pages that you don't control where CSS will leak can be frustrating
- Converting time zones is hard and confusing
- Naming things is hard
- Naming things that link to time conversion is even harder
- It's easy to get into refactoring hell (as shown by commit history)
- It's easy to stay in refactoring hell (trying to make something future proofed)
- Unit tests and test driven development is key
- TypeScript is amazing

**I learned a lot and it's all worth it**

I was going to add the whole story to a blog post, but instead I've hidden it away on the following page. It's a bit of a ramble but I learned so much over the course of completing this thing so I wanted to document it at least for myself: [read on](https://www.notion.so/Story-19d0c265934c40ea9195855851c4f1be)
