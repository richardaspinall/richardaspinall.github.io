I was recommended a book called <i>Designing Your Life</i> via my coach. This book takes you through "how to build a well-lived joyful life" making you do simple exercises that guide and help you come up and with a bit of a solution to what you should be doing now and into the future. The first one being: How full are you?

<br>

This simple question that asks you to rate: **Work, Play, Health and Love** gave me immediate insight into where I need to spend my energy.

**Work** and **Love** being full, which is a great thing! My work definitely occupies enough of my life, and this isn't just my day job, this is the work I'm doing right here to get me to the next thing in my career. Love entails relationships, friends and family and is definitely full!

<br>

I'm in pretty good physical shape but my mental **Health** always needs to be looked after and that's why I rated it a 2.

<br>

**Play** is the big one which working on will directly push up my health too. This is about things that bring you joy for the sake of doing, not for something or someone else but makes you purely feel joyful. For me the biggest thing that gives me joy is shooting hoops. I can shoot until I wear myself out and it gives me blissful joy.
