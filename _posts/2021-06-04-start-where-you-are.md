I was recommended a book called <i>Designing Your Life</i> via my coach. This book takes you through "how to build a well-lived joyful life" making you do simple exercises that guide and help you come up and with a bit of a solution to what you should be doing now and into the future. The first one being: How full are you?

This simple question that asks you to rate: Work, Play, Health and Love gave me immediate insight into where I need to spend my energy.
